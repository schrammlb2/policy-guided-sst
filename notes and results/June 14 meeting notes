visualizations for paper
	show random policy for t=0 
		Success ratio only

	Show plots for first ~50 seconds only for PickAndPlace

	Domain shift 
		Add drift to Asteroids environment

	Obstacles

	Confirm results
		Confidence intervals


	Start on paper
		Look at Rl-RRT and see how they frame problem and explanation

	Add other search algorithms to paper? 

	Priorities
		1) CI and confirming results
		2) Writing
		3) domain shift for asteroids -- add drift
